## üîç Verifying Deployment

### Check if deployment is working:
1. Visit your Vercel URL
2. Test the URL scanner feature
3. Test the QR code scanner
4. Test the AI Security Assistant chat

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue**: "Cannot use 'import.meta' outside a module"
- **Solution**: This is expected and won't affect the deployed version on Vercel

**Issue**: AI Assistant not responding
- **Solution**: Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` are set correctly in Vercel

**Issue**: QR Scanner not working
- **Solution**: The app needs HTTPS to access camera. Vercel provides this automatically.

**Issue**: 404 errors on refresh
- **Solution**: Vercel's `vercel.json` file handles this automatically with rewrites

## üìã Environment Variables Checklist

‚úÖ **Required for basic functionality:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for server-side AI calls)
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` (for client-side AI calls)
