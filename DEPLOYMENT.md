# PaySavvy Pro - Deployment Guide

## Replit Deployment

### Current Issue: "Could not find run command"
This error occurs when Replit's deployment system cannot identify the proper entry point for the application.

### Solution
The project includes multiple deployment configurations:
- `server.js` - Main Express server (port 5000)
- `start.js` - Production start script with error handling
- `run.sh` - Shell script for deployment environments
- `Procfile` - Process configuration for cloud platforms

### Replit Deployment Steps
1. Click "Deploy" in your Replit workspace
2. If you see "could not find run command", the system should use `server.js` as the default
3. The server runs on port 5000 with proper health check endpoints
4. Environment variables are automatically injected through `server.js`

## Vercel Deployment (Alternative)

### Issue Resolution for Static Deployment

The screenshots show Vercel deployed an unstyled, broken version because the project configuration was incorrect for static deployment.

## Fixed Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Clean Files
```bash
# Extract project files
tar -xzf paysavvy-pro-responsive-final.tar.gz

# Remove problematic build files
rm -rf dist/ node_modules/ .git/
rm vite.config.js
```

### 2. Upload Essential Files to GitHub
Core files needed for working deployment:
- `index.html` - Main application with full functionality
- `main.js` - Complete JavaScript with all 6 features
- `style.css` - Green-white responsive theme
- `database.js` - Client-side data management
- `src/` folder - All components and utilities
- `vercel.json` - Simplified static deployment config
- `.env.example` - Environment template

### 3. Vercel Configuration Fixed
The `vercel.json` is now optimized for static deployment:
```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "headers": [...security headers...]
}
```

### 4. Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
Set exactly this in your Vercel project settings:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key
```

### 5. Deploy Process
1. Import GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel detects as static site (no build process)
3. Direct file serving for optimal performance
4. Automatic HTTPS and CDN distribution

## What This Fixes

✅ **Styling Issues**: Green-white theme loads properly
✅ **JavaScript Functionality**: All 6 advanced features work
✅ **AI Integration**: OpenAI API calls function correctly
