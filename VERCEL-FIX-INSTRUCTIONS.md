# Vercel Deployment Fix - Updated Instructions

## The Problem
Your deployment failed because the old `vercel.json` was configured for serverless functions, but PaySavvy Pro works as a static site.

## Solution: Updated Files

I've fixed the `vercel.json` configuration. Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Update Your Repository
1. Download the new file: `paysavvy-pro-vercel-fixed.tar.gz`
2. Extract it to replace your current project files
3. In GitHub Desktop, you'll see the changed `vercel.json` file
4. Commit with message: "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
5. Push to GitHub

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project and click on it
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. Or it will automatically redeploy when you push the GitHub changes

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Vercel project settings:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-key-here
```

## What Was Fixed
- Removed serverless function configuration
- Configured for static site deployment
- Added proper Content Security Policy for camera access
- Fixed routing to work with single-page application

Your deployment should now work correctly!
