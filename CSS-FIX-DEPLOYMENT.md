# CSS Build Error Fix - Final Deployment Instructions

## Problem Fixed
The CSS syntax error has been resolved. There was an extra closing brace `}` that was breaking the build process.

## Updated Files
- **index.html**: Fixed CSS syntax error
- **vercel.json**: Configured for static deployment (no build process)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Download Fixed Package
Download: `paysavvy-pro-css-fixed.tar.gz`

### 2. Update GitHub Repository
1. Extract the fixed files over your existing project
2. In GitHub Desktop, commit changes: "Fix CSS syntax error for Vercel deployment"
3. Push to GitHub

### 3. Configure Vercel Project Settings
When setting up your Vercel project:

**Build & Development Settings:**
- Framework Preset: `Other`
- Build Command: **Leave Empty**
- Output Directory: `./`
- Install Command: `npm install`
- Root Directory: `./`

**Environment Variables:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-openai-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-your-openai-key-here
```

### 4. Deploy
Click "Deploy" - it should now work without build errors.

## What Was Fixed
1. Removed extra CSS closing brace causing PostCSS parser error
2. Configured vercel.json to skip build process since PaySavvy Pro is a complete static application
3. Added proper static file serving configuration

Your deployment will now succeed and your app will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
