â€¦but the live camera feed still isnâ€™t displaying, then this is almost certainly a mobile browser UI rendering issueâ€”usually caused by a CSS layout conflict, improper z-index, or unmounted DOM element.

Letâ€™s debug this in 5 structured PhD-level steps on Replit, guaranteed to resolve your camera not displaying issue:

âœ… Step 1: Force Visible Video â€” Use DevTools
Check this manually in mobile DevTools (or remote inspect):

js
Copy
Edit
const video = document.querySelector("#cameraFeed");
video.style.display = "block";
video.style.visibility = "visible";
video.style.opacity = 1;
video.style.zIndex = 9999;
video.srcObject // should not be null
If video.srcObject is set but the video element is invisible, itâ€™s likely a CSS issue.

âœ… Step 2: Patch CSS & DOM Positioning
In your style.css or index.html head, add this temporary forced CSS to rule out layout blockers:

css
Copy
Edit
#cameraFeed {
  position: fixed !important;
  top: 0 !important;
  left: 0 !important;
  width: 100vw !important;
  height: 100vh !important;
  z-index: 9999 !important;
  display: block !important;
  background: black;
  object-fit: cover;
}
Also make sure the container is not display: none, nor accidentally removed from the DOM.

âœ… Step 3: Manually Call Play and Watch for Error
In console:

js
Copy
Edit
const video = document.querySelector("#cameraFeed");
try {
  await video.play();
  console.log("âœ… video.play() triggered successfully");
} catch (e) {
  console.error("ðŸš« play() failed", e);
}
If it fails silently, it's a policy issue (autoplay, muted) or video element not mounted yet when play is called.

âœ… Step 4: Debug with Minimal HTML Block (Test Camera Outside)
In Replit, create a test HTML page to isolate the issue:

html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Test Camera</title>
  <style>
    video {
      width: 100vw;
      height: 100vh;
      object-fit: cover;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <video id="cameraFeed" autoplay muted playsinline></video>
  <script>
    const video = document.getElementById("cameraFeed");
    navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: "environment" } })
      .then(stream => {
        video.srcObject = stream;
        return video.play();
      })
      .then(() => console.log("ðŸŽ¥ Camera started"))
      .catch(err => console.error("ðŸš« Error starting camera", err));
  </script>
</body>
</html>
If this test works, the issue is in your main app's UI overlay logic (z-index, transitions, or race condition).

âœ… Step 5: Use Replit AI Final Debug Prompt
If you want Replit AI to auto-debug the whole logic, use this refined final system prompt:

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Fix mobile QR scanner camera view not showing, even after permission granted and video element setup.

ðŸ§  Context:
- `getUserMedia` stream is granted and attached to video.srcObject
- `video.play()` is called
- video element has `autoplay`, `muted`, `playsinline`
- File upload fallback works, but camera feed never shows
- Issue confirmed on Chrome Android and Safari iOS

âœ… Please:
1. Add explicit CSS to force video display
2. Confirm DOM is fully loaded before calling `video.play()`
3. Delay `requestAnimationFrame(scan)` until `video.readyState === 4`
4. Log when `video.srcObject` is set
5. Ensure `video.play()` is wrapped in try/catch
6. Check camera feed isnâ€™t obscured by UI elements (e.g. modals)
7. Move video element to top layer with `z-index: 9999`
