### Latest Scam Tactics:
1.
Phishing Websites and Typosquatting:

-
TNG:
Scammers are creating phishing websites that mimic the official TNG portal. These sites often use typosquatting techniques, such as replacing letters in the domain name (e.g., "t0uchngo.com" instead of "touchngo.com").
-
GrabPay & Boost:
Similar tactics are used, with domains like "grabbpay.com" or "bo0stpay.com" appearing. These sites are designed to harvest login credentials and personal information.
2.
Fake Promotions and Cashback Offers:

-
TNG:
Fraudsters send messages via SMS or email, promising cashback or rewards for clicking on a link and logging in. These links lead to phishing sites.
-
GrabPay & Boost:
Scammers use social media platforms to promote fake contests or giveaways, requiring users to enter personal information to claim their "prize."
3.
Social Engineering and Impersonation:

-
TNG:
Scammers impersonate TNG customer service representatives, contacting users via phone or messaging apps, claiming there are issues with their account that require immediate action.
-
GrabPay & Boost:
Fraudsters pose as company officials, urging users to verify their account details to avoid suspension.
4.
Malware and App Clones:

-
TNG:
Malicious apps that mimic the TNG app are distributed through unofficial app stores. These apps are designed to steal sensitive information once installed.
-
GrabPay & Boost:
Similar cloned apps are used to capture login credentials and financial data.
### Recommendations:
1.
Verify URLs and Domains:

- Always check the URL for any typos or suspicious TLDs (.tk, .ml, .ga). Use PaySavvy Pro's domain reputation scoring to verify legitimacy.
2.
Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Communications:

- Do not click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Verify any communication by contacting the financial institution directly using official contact details.
3.
Install Apps from Official Sources:

- Only download apps from official app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store) and verify the developer's name.
4.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

- Use 2FA for an additional layer of security on your e-wallet accounts.
5.
Regularly Monitor Transactions:

- Frequently check your transaction history for any unauthorized activities and report suspicious transactions immediately.
6.
Educate Yourself and Others:

- Stay informed about the latest scams and share information with family and friends to increase awareness.
